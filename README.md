# Is-Even
Have you ever wanted to check if a number is even in JavaScript? Now you can!

# Instructions
In JavaScript, call function isEven() and pass the number you want to check. You can pass either the number, or a string version
(e.g. 500, five hundred, FIVE HUNDRED, Five Hundred are all accepted)!

You can either use the JavaScript file as-is, where the max is set to 500,000, or you can edit the PHP file and set your own 
maximum with buildContents()!

Function returns true on even values, and false for odd values.
